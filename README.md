# Magisteria

A deckbuilding card game in the vein of Star Realms and Ascension. Combine spells, summons, and synergies from four schools of magic to defeat your opponent in a sorceror's duel!

## Future Ideas

- Guardian
- Discard bonuses
- Gain X resource for every other card of this color you have in play
  - or enemy?
- Ability effects: casting for 0 mana, putting cast spells directly into play instead of the discard pile
- I like Ascension's mechanic of defeating cards in the market row for bonuses
- Event cards that affect both players when they appear in the market row
- The ability to permanently remove cards from the game
- buffing summons (maybe a light school)
- bonuses against summons
- discounts or even free acquisition (with conditions, like same color)
- synergizing with multiple other schools
- summon abilities that cost mana to play (e.g. let you convert mana into might)
- More schools of magic?
- cards the imediately go to the top of your deck upon acquisition
  - or even your hand
- "achievement" cards that trigger effects based on other things you've done that turn (e.g. commander that adds HP to summons if you play 2 or more that turn, or "bounty" card that gains resources if you kill a summon)
- tapping/stunning/freezing summons that takes them out of play for a turn
