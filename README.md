# Magisteria

A deckbuilding card game in the vein of Star Realms and Ascension. Combine spells, summons, and synergies from four schools of magic to defeat your opponent in a sorceror's duel!

## Future Ideas

- Guardian summons which protect the caster
- More schools of magic?
- Ability effects: casting for 0 mana, putting cast spells directly into play instead of the discard pile
- I like Ascension's mechanic of defeating cards in the market row for bonuses
- Event cards that affect both players when they appear in the market row
- The ability to permanently remove cards from the game
- buffing summons (maybe a light school)
- bonuses against summons
- synergizing with multiple other schools
